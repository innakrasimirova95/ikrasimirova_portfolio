        description: `For five months, I developed a 3D BIM viewer using ThatOpenCompany and Three.js, creating an interactive interface for IFC models within an application with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Material UI. I converted this viewer into a reusable library, developed a FastAPI API connected to Autodesk ACC to download BIM models, and deployed the projects on Azure, integrating them into the company's cloud environment.

Additionally, I developed and integrated a complete BIM model management project with a frontend made with React and a backend with Django, where I implemented authentication with Entra ID, connection to the Autodesk ACC API to import BIM models, and local model loading. I also incorporated my BIM viewer into this system, allowing models to be viewed directly on the platform.

Subsequently, I collaborated on both the frontend and backend of an IoT sensor-oriented project, integrating my viewer and supporting dashboards with Recharts, navigation with React Router, and real-time data visualization. I also worked on the backend with Node.js, PostgreSQL, WebSockets, and Azure services like Blob Storage.

This experience allowed me to take my own BIM viewer from its conception to its integration into real platforms: an enterprise BIM project manager and a cloud IoT data solution.`
